A card-dealing machine made with Raspberry Pi 3 and Lego bricks.

- Implemented real-time object detection with TensorFlow Lite framework on Raspberry Pi 3, dealing cards based on playersâ€™ coordinates, which achieved fast and high accuracy result with limited computing power.

- Applied the technologies of Internet of Things for bi-directional communications between Rpi and control server, sending control signals to Rpi after analyzing data that received from electronical devices
